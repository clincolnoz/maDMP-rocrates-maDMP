 - description : The purpose of this experiment is to find out whether or not certain "patterns" can be found in popular movies. Maybe there are certain decades that produced a much higher number of popular movies than others, maybe certain actresses*actors are featured more frequently than others. Are there certain genres which are more popular than the rest? This data could not only be useful for film studios, but also for TV broadcasters or streaming services.
