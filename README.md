## Task description

RO-Crate[5][5]
is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with
their metadata. It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in
formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an
individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research
environments.
Machine-actionable DMPs[6][6]
(maDMPs) are an emerging standard for exchange of DMPs between
systems involved in research data management. There are certain overlaps in the scope of maDMPs
and ro-crates. Reuse and transfer of information between the maDMPs and ro-crates can facilitate
adoption of both and reduce workload imposed on researchers to document their data.
In this task you will:
- Define a mapping between ro-crate 1.0 and maDMPs
- Develop a tool that
  - Extracts relevant information from an maDMP and creates ro-crates [1 to many]
  - Reuses information from ro-crates to generate a maDMP [many to 1]
To test your mapping and the tool, you will:
- Extract information from maDMPs to create ro-crates
  - 5 selected maDMPs from the Data Stewardship community[7]
  - 5 examples from the RDA Repository[8]
(must include ex9-dmp-long)
- Use information from ro-crates to fill in maDMPs
  - 3 example RO-crates from the official ro-crate website
  - 2 realistic examples of RO-crates created by you to test the coverage of your mapping
Donâ€™t forget to validate the generated maDMPs against the provided JSON schema. The mapping must
be as complete as possible.
