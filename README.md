## Task description

RO-Crate[5]
is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with
their metadata. It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in
formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an
individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research
environments.

Machine-actionable DMPs[6]
(maDMPs) are an emerging standard for exchange of DMPs between
systems involved in research data management. There are certain overlaps in the scope of maDMPs
and ro-crates. Reuse and transfer of information between the maDMPs and ro-crates can facilitate
adoption of both and reduce workload imposed on researchers to document their data.
In this task you will:
- Define a mapping between ro-crate 1.0 and maDMPs
- Develop a tool that
  - Extracts relevant information from an maDMP and creates ro-crates [1 to many]
  - Reuses information from ro-crates to generate a maDMP [many to 1]
To test your mapping and the tool, you will:
- Extract information from maDMPs to create ro-crates
  - 5 selected maDMPs from the Data Stewardship community[7]
  - 5 examples from the RDA Repository[8]
(must include ex9-dmp-long)
- Use information from ro-crates to fill in maDMPs
  - 3 example RO-crates from the official ro-crate website
  - 2 realistic examples of RO-crates created by you to test the coverage of your mapping
Donâ€™t forget to validate the generated maDMPs against the provided JSON schema. The mapping must
be as complete as possible.

## Prerequisites
developed using python 3.7.5
```bash
# create environment
python -m venv datasteward_venv

# activate venv
source datasteward_venv/bin/activate

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running scripts and examples
**core scripts**  
To convert a dmp to multiple rocrates:  
```bash
python src/madmp_to_rocrates.py -path <path to madmp file> [-path_schema <url to RDA-DMP-Common-Standard schema>]
```
To convert rocrates to maDMP:
```bash
python src/rocrates_to_madmp.py -path <root path to search for rocrates> [-path_schema <url to RDA-DMP-Common-Standard schema>] [-dmp_identifier <madmp unique identifier>]
```
To compare the 2 maDMP's
```bash
python src/compare_dictionaries.py -path_d1 <path to dict 1> -path_d2 <path to dict 2> [-path_report <path where comparison report is saved>]
```

**examples**  
A jupyter notebook (notebooks/run_examples.ipynb) runs several examples of converting maDMP to rcrates and back as well as rocrate to DMP

## Implementation
The initial and working implementation used the ro-crate 0.1.0 definitions. Bringing this in line with ro-crate 1.0 is under development in in the development branch. The following references the ro-crate 0.1.0 version.

###Mappings:
The following uses the syntax:  
- ```<madmp key(s)>: <rocrate key(s)> ```
- key1::key2 for nested keys in both read and write columns
- '-': dict to insert values into rocrate
- ```<madmp key(s)>: [<rocrate key(s)>, <mappingg for nessted dict>]```

```python

### comments
The main problems were:
- ro-crate temporalCoverage as this requires 'start/stop' for the dataset which the dmp doesnt
- the dmp data_access value doesnt map to an instance or property of ro-crate. The proposed solution was to create a sub dict with the dataset id as @id and add type @ActiveActionStatus plus the dmp value. The ActiveActionStatus is not a good match.
- ro-crate requires a datePublished for the dataset, which is absent in the dmp but the dmp value modified was used but modified actually refers to teh dmp itself and not the datasets within.
- the dmp proerties ethical_issues_exist, ethical_issues_report and ethical_issues_description were put in a sub dict with type ethicsPolicy, which was not a terrible fit but refers to an actual policy document and the dmp properties were simple mpoved there 1:1
- similarly i could not find a ro-crate class or instance that covered the dmp dataset properies peronal_data and sensitive_data. These were omitted.
- The dmp identifer is also absent from the produced ro-crate as the top level identifier is that of the dataset. The solution for ro-crate to dmp was to have a user input for he dmp identifier, which also makes sense if the task is to convert ro-crates to a dmp where a dmp doesnt exist
- dmp->dataset->distribution->host geo_location, pid_system and support versioning are absent
- dmp dataset properties data_quality_assurance, metadata, preservation_statement, security_and_privacy, technical_resource are absent
- I tried to do it by parsing dicts and lists through the nested structures. This basically will never work and in particular for the flat structure of ro-crate 1.0

## Comments
Continuing this project would require a complete restructure and essentially create a ro-crate line by line using the values from the dmp, similarly to this <https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py>. Similarly, for the ro-crate to dmp.
